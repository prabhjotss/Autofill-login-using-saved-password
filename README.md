ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Custom Instagram Login Page

Excited to share a project I recently worked on! I created a customized login page for Instagram which actually login same as original using a blend of modern web technologies:

ðŸ”¹ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
ðŸ”¹ Backend: Node.js, Express.js
ðŸ”¹ Automation & Testing: Selenium
ðŸ”¹ APIs: Integrated REST APIs for seamless functionality

Key Features:

âœ… A fully responsive and user-friendly interface
âœ… Secure login mechanism integrated with REST APIs
âœ… Automated form testing using Selenium for enhanced reliability

This project allowed me to explore and combine multiple technologies while sharpening my skills in web development, automation, and API integration. It was an incredible learning experience, pushing me to think creatively and implement industry practices.

Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts! Feel free to connect if you're interested in tech, automation, or innovative projects.
